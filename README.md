## Info

This CRUD application lists all available products in a datatable. These products can be edited and removed and new products can be added. The application state is persisted using Redux and Firebase is utilized as a simple backend/database. Formik is used instead of Redux Form in order to avoid updating the Redux state every time a user changes the input value.

## Future improvements

In the future, user authentication will be added in order for each user to have his/her own products ahown after logging in.

## Instructions

Clone the repository and 'npm install' to install all the dependencies specified in 'package.json'. 
Then 'npm start' to start the application. Yarn can be used as an alternative to 'npm'
